### Vesting

指的是一种公司让员工通过一个期限来挣到公司授予他的股权的技巧。公司也可以通过定期授予员工**股权**或**期权**来得到类似的效果，但是这一过程过于复杂并且效果也不会很理想。因而一般的做法是雇佣员工时预先给他授予股权，但是会将这些股权都 **Vest**（绑定）一定的期限。另外，公司有的时候也会给受雇了很多年的员工提供一定数量的股权（叫做 **Retention grants** ，目的就是为了留住优秀员工），不过这些股权同样应该被称作 Vest 。

具体到股权和期权上来说，Vesting 会有一点的不同。

- 在**期权**上，你被预先授予的一定数量的期权只有在你完成了 Vest 后，它们才会属于你。
- 而在**股权**上，你被授予的那些股权立即就归属于你，但是对于没有完成 Vest 的那部分股权，公司则拥有回购的权力。

尽管有这样一个微小的不同点，但是其作用都是一样的，那就是员工必须通过一段期限才能挣到公司授予他们的股权或者期权。

所以如果你是一个公司员工的话，你更加需要关心的是你每年能够 Vest 多少股权或者期权。公司授予的股权数量多少固然重要，但是每年你能够 Vest 的数量才是你真正能够拿到手的那部分补偿。

大部分的 Vesting 期限（一般是 4 年）开始前都会有一个一年期的 **cliff vest** 期限，也就是说你只有在受雇满一年才会 vest 到股权，没有满一年的话，你不会 vest 任何股权；而一年以后股权的 vest 频率就变成了每月一次或者每个季度一次了。推行一年期限的 cliff vest 制度的原因主要在于其能有效的防止公司和股东被恶意员工卷走大量股权。如果被证实该员工为恶意员工，则在 cliff vest 期间，公司就可以将其清退而不会形成任何的股权稀释。

关于 cliff vesting 有两个问题值得注意。

- 第一种情况，如果员工的一年雇佣期限快到了，你又决定将其清除出公司，那么你多多少少的应该给他们 vest 一定数量的股权。因为一般情况下，不可能说你需要花接近一年的时间才能搞清楚那员工是不是恶意员工，而且在别人即将完成 cliff vest 期限的时候，将别人开除也是不道德的行为。
- 第二种情况，员工的雇佣还没满一年，而你需要把公司卖了。我的看法是，如果员工受雇还不到一年你就必须把公司卖了，那么这种情况下，你不能采用 cliff vest 的规则。毕竟卖掉公司的时候是每个付出了努力并拥有股权的员工都应该获得报酬的时候。

## What Is the Meaning of Vesting Date in Stock Options?

> Ref: https://budgeting.thenest.com/meaning-vesting-date-stock-options-22904.html

It seems like just yesterday that your employer gave you options to buy 1,000 shares of company stock at $10 a share. Today, the market price jumped to $15 a share. You're itching to exercise the options, buy the shares and flip the stock for a quick $5,000 profit. But not so fast. If your options are like most incentive stock options, you're going to have to wait, fingers crossed, until the big "vesting date."

### Employee Stock Options

All kinds of companies give their employees stock options as incentives. An employee stock option gives you the opportunity to buy shares of your employer's stock at a predetermined "strike price." If the strike price is lower than the market price of the stock at the time you can exercise the option, then you stand to make a nice profit. The aim of the stock option is to align your interests with those of your company's shareholders — namely, you all want the stock to go up.


### Vesting Date

When you get an incentive stock option, you typically can't use it right away. It wouldn't be much of an "incentive," after all, if your profit came baked right in and you could enjoy it immediately. You usually have to stay with the company a certain length of time to become eligible to exercise your options. The date when options truly become "yours" to exercise is the vesting date.

### Vesting Schedules

Stock options "vest" according to a vesting schedule, and companies can set the schedules to reflect the kind of incentive they're trying to give. For example, a company could give you options on 6,000 shares that vest all at once in five years, which would be designed to keep you around for the long haul. Or you could get staggered options that reward you in stages, with, say, 100 options a month for five years. The company may let you exercise options immediately after each batch "vests," or only in stages, or you may not be able to exercise them until you either get fully vested or you leave the company.

### The Cliff

One common vesting technique goes by the name of "the cliff." This requires a specific period of time before any options vest at all. For example, you may have to work for a full year or two years before vesting begins, after which your options begin to vest on a regular schedule. The cliff serves several purposes, such as maintaining a strong incentive and preventing take-the-money-and-run situations soon after the options are granted. For start-ups that give new hires options — not an uncommon practice — the cliff can protect the company from the possibility of a bad hire racking up vested stock options that the company would then have to let him exercise right before the employee is terminated.
